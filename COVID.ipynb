        "The Coronavirus outbreak in 2020 can be considered one of the greatest challenges the world has faced in the last century. I have written this article on november 13 and the number of deaths is 1.297.347 in the whole world. In contrary of what many people think, Covid's proagnosis is not so terrible when compared to other deseases. Ebola outbreak in Western Africa in 2014 presented a fatality rate of around 70% in patients between 15 and 44 years old (Yes, only 3 in 10 patients could survive\"). The problem about Covid-19 is how contagious it is. Differently from other desases, such Ebola that once you have it you need to be hospitalized, Covid-19 is a brief and mild desease for many people and some are even asymptomatics. This way, infected people can move around and infect many other people. The desease has its origin in China and in a so globalized world it soon was present in every continent. I don't need to describe how serious this desease was ... I am sure everyone who is reading this article witnessed the caos Covid-19 brought to many countries. \n",
        "The Covid-19 outbreak is not the first pandemic the world has faced but it certainly is the first time we can overcome it through technology and of course data. Therefore, that's a great opportunity to analyze and have some insights from this desease. \n",
        "For this analysis, we are going to use three Python libraries: Pandas to manipulate the data, Matplotlib and Seaborn for vizualisation. This is a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) but much can be done and you will see how easy to work with and powerful these libraries are.\n",
        "\n",
        "Talk briefly about what I did in this EDA"
